      I'm currently a Senior Developer 2 at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.delta.com/" target="_blank">Delta Airlines</a>, building <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.delta.com/" target="_blank">Digital Cabin Experience domain products</a> for a leading US-based airline company with some awesome people. I graduated
      <a class="underline-link" href="#" target="_blank">KNIT</a> in 2018 after completing three awesome internships at
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://syandan.com/" target="_blank">Syandan</a>,
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://picntic.com/" target="_blank">Picntic</a>, and

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful and scalable product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
